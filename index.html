      I just watched Shereef's Fireside Chat and really liked his Kitchen v. Table (Restaurant) example. I will say that my expectations of DBC didn't change, but maybe that's because of the research I've done on DBC prior to applying and starting Phase 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just because my expectations didn't change doesn't mean I'm not nervous. I am very nervous. I do sorta catch myself having a restaurant mindset, but even worse, I find that I definitely have a fixed mindset and have viewed things with a fixed mindset my whole life. I tend to expect myself to fail and it keeps me from experimenting. One of the main factors in choosing to do DBC is the hope that I can be guided into a different lifestyle and thought process. I think it's great that DBC has a setup where you can not only learn code and become a great developer, but also you can become a better person.
    </p>
    <p>
        The learning experience will probably take some getting used to for me, and I know I won't be able to change my mindset overnight. I know I will be passive, I know I am a novice, and I know at times I can struggle keeping up, but I think I'm already in the process of changing my lifestyle, and that's something I'm very excited about. I know there will be many people in the same boat as me, and I can't wait to meet them and go down this crazy river with them.
