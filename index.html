      I just watched Shereef's Fireside Chat and really liked his Kitchen v. Table (Restaurant) example. I will say that my expectations of DBC didn't change, but maybe that's because of the research I've done on DBC prior to applying and starting Phase 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just because my expectations didn't change doesn't mean I'm not nervous. I am very nervous. I do sorta catch myself having a restaurant mindset, but even worse, I find that I definitely have a fixed mindset and have viewed things with a fixed mindset my whole life. I tend to expect myself to fail and it keeps me from experimenting. One of the main factors in choosing to do DBC is the hope that I can be guided into a different lifestyle and thought process. I think it's great that DBC has a setup where you can not only learn code and become a great developer, but also you can become a better person.
    </p>
    <p>
        The learning experience will probably take some getting used to for me, and I know I won't be able to change my mindset overnight. I know I will be passive, I know I am a novice, and I know at times I can struggle keeping up, but I think I'm already in the process of changing my lifestyle, and that's something I'm very excited about. I know there will be many people in the same boat as me, and I can't wait to meet them and go down this crazy river with them.

      Git is a type of version control that helps its users keep track of work flow. Git helps you save your changes as you go, so you will always have safe spots to fall back on should you make a mistake with your code in the future. Git also works well when multiple people are working on the same project. Git helps those people work on different tasks at the same time without worry of working on an outdated file. Git allows branches of the tree to be modified, without any worry of the trunk being destroyed.
    </p>

       Anytime a change is made to a file, it will show up in your git status. Typing git status into your terminal will bring up a few sections. If your file is new, you will see it in the Untracked Files section. If you made a change to an existing file, you will see it in the Changes Not Staged For Commit section. Git provides instructions for each section on how to go about sending these files to the Changes To Be Committed section. Think of committing as a final confirmation before pushing these files to the web. You can only push files after they have been committed. Once pushed, they will appear remotely on the web, in this case GitHub.

       
    </p>

        GitHub allows users to send their work to the web easily by linking up with the Git on their computer. With GitHub, Bob in TN can work on a project with Lynn in VA and they both can get updates by pushing and pulling their work to/from GitHub. Git helps you keep track of your changes by easily accessing a log by typing git log in your terminal. Your git log shows every change that has been pushed to GitHub.
