  <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
  <h2>Understanding the Difference in Ruby</h2>

      I made a small tweak to the blog template so hopefully this works. More tweaks to come tomorrow. Arrays and hashes can both be useful tools in Ruby because instead of storing and assigning one variable at a time, A+H's let you store multiple variables at once. The difference is in how these values are stored.
    </p>
    <p>
        An array stores variables in an ordered fashion and saves each variable as a number (starting with 0) based on the order you store them in the array. Because of this an array is great for storing an ordered list of items.
    </p>
    <p>
        A hash on the other hand pairs the variables with a key and a value. Basically, each variable (value) can be named (key) so you can easily call upon that variable without having to know which place in the order it lands. I'm still in the very early stages of using both arrays and hashes, but they seem to be so similar that once you get the hang of using one, the other should be extremely easy to pickup.
