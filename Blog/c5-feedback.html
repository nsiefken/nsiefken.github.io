  <h2>Giving Feedback To Pairing Sessions</h2>
  <h4>4-17-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      Pairing at times can be interesting, although I do like them more than I thought I would. It can really be a benefit to bounce ideas off another student and ideally finish the challenge quicker since there's two of us on it. At times I like to work at my own pace, and I hate if my pair knows a LOT more than me and I feel like I slow them down. My ideal scenario is working with someone friendly, who has about the same knowledge as I do on these challenges beacuse I hate the thought of typing out ideas too slowly for my pair and/or guide.

      When it comes to feedback most of the time I feel pretty good about it. I have struggled at other times in my life responding to negative feedback, even when the person giving the feedback means no harm. The one thing I really feel I need to do during pair sessions is be ready to quickly research an issue. I am still struggling with the Ruby docs and a couple times my pair has asked me to find our issue in the docs, so I need to get more familiar with the information that is there for us in the docs.

      Writing feedback is ok, I don't feel like it is very anonymous at DBC. It seems to be ordered in the exact order I paired, and I didn't have to do many pairing sessions before I was able to read the feedback given to me. Because of this, I have a hard time being mean or giving actionable feedback. For 1, I am a beginner, I mean who am I to tell someone how they should work through these challenges. And 2, I don't want to come across as ungreatful after someone helped me complete the challenge, b/c almost every time I've paried so far I've felt it helped me complete the challenge and that I was better off pairing than doing it on my own. So yes, I enjoy the pairing, but I just don't want to be giving my review of someone when I feel they can easily figure out it was me giving that review.
