  <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
  <h2>And Relating It To DBC</h2>
  <h4>April Fools Day, 2015</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I have a concrete sequential thinking style and I haven't been able to figure out if that's good for me or bad for me. I definitely tend to go step by step in my thought process, but I am terrible at imagining what the end result will look like before I get there. I definitely wish I was better at thinking outside the box. However, I think the step by step approach has helped me so far in Phase0 b/c of how the challenges are presented to us at the beginning of each week.

        I feel that one of the biggest struggles for me is thinking of the answer quickly, especially one that takes multiple steps or has multiple ways of getting to the answer. At times it's nice that DBC is on my own time and my own schedule, but then when it comes to pairing I sometimes feel like I don't have enough time to stop and think about the solution.

        I've mentioned it before but one of the reason I decided to do DBC was to change my mindset from fixed to growth. I understand I won't be able to fully change the way I think, but I want to rid myself of becoming depressed when I don't succeed. I tend to get frustrated and give up, and I don't want to be that way anymore. It happened once to me during week 1 and once during week 2 where I felt this information I was trying to learn was way over my head, and that all the other students were picking it up quicker than me, I have to keep reminding myself to push those thoughts out of my head and keep trying. Eventually I can get it, and the frustrating times will quickly pass.

        It's very hard for me to formulate a plan right now (who knows, maybe it's because of my mindset). I just don't know exactly what I need to do to prepare myself for Phase 1. I've worked in the city before and I have worked a long schedule of 12 hour days, 6-7 days a week, so I am not intimdated right now by the workload that phase 1 will bring. I usually get along with people well, and I truely am looking forward to meeting everyone and working with them in person, but I don't know right now about fixing my mindset. The only thing I can say is I want to be aware of my thoughts at all time and I want to catch myself before I go down the path to frustration.
