  <h2>Test-Driven Development</h2>
  <h4>5-5-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I decided to do a little research on test-driven development because I've realized I like the DBC challenges that require us to pass each test before moving on to the next section of our code. In test-driven development the first thing that's done is writing a test that fails but sets a goal of what you want the code to accomplish. The code should ideally be written in as few lines and as refactored as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
       The key to test-driven development is knowing what you want your program to do. You need to be able to understand what your end result should look like before starting. Once you realize what you want you can write a test that will pass once that specific code is implemented. Once you write the code that passes the test, you move on to another test to accomplish a new programming goal. And so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Test-driven development is great for working out a problem step by step. Moving through the code one test at a time can help pin point what code is working perfectly, and what code is breaking the program (b/c of course you shouldn't move on with your programming until the test you're working on passes). Ideally your end code will be cleaner and drier using this technique because you are only writing the minimum code to pass each of your tests.

  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  
  <h4>5-5-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I still don't feel very comfortable talking about personal and private situations on a blog, having no clue who will read it and when it may possibly be read. And I don't even mind talking about personal situations, I would just prefer to do it in a personal setting, not a public one (without any direct feedback). For the sake of doing this assignment I will talk about a small conflict I had in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conflict I can look back and laugh at happened when I was rooming with one of my best friends. I've been friends with him for 10 years now and I can't believe looking back that we had a period of about a month where we lived together but didn't talk to each other. Things built up over time but boiled over one night when I was in the basement watching TV pretty late at night and my friend, Ross, told me that another guy was going to stay the night. No big deal, we were like a hotel, guys and girls stayed over all the time. But in this case, the person was going to sleep in the basement (where I was watching TV), and was going to go to bed now and I need to go upstairs. This bothered me for multiple reasons: 1. things were starting to build up between us anyway, so I didn't have a desire to do something nice for him, but 2. I didn't appreciate being told what I had to do, and I also didn't like that it was in favor of some other guy that I didn't know and who didn't live with us. I was angry b/c I felt like I wasn't being treated like a good friend. We were both stubborn and we both tried to stand our ground, for faaaaaaar too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back on it I can't even remember the things that built up before that incident, I think a lot of little things split up our friendship slowly and then that just threw a huge wedge in there. Some questions arose like "maybe we aren't that great of friends, and maybe we shouldn't be living together". We gave each other a lot of space for a few weeks after that and then finally apologized for acting like idiots. Now we are great friends still today, I thought about writing this b/c it really does shock me that we ever argued at all. I don't think we have since. I definitely would go back in time and talk through the situation even before the incident happened. There was no need to try and stand our ground and act the the alpha male. I've definitely learned over the years that it's almost always better to talk through any issues or thoughts I'm having, before the build up and become more difficult to control. It's kind of a stupid example for this assignment, but it was a disagreement that I look back on and just laugh.

  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h2>Exploring Values For DBC</h2>
  <h4>5-1-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      The two values that really stuck out were Accomplishment and Meaningful Work. I'm always trying to live up to these values, it always seems like I have someone in the back of my head telling me to do something more meaningful. That's kinda where I am today, I was unsatisfied with my past and I wanted to push myself as far as I can to see what I can acheive. But I still am always looking for someone else to tell me I'm valuable/needed/wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's kinda funny, the topics I get asked for advice on tend to deal with sports or relationships. Both things are very, very important in my life but they aren't the values I worry/think about the most. Maybe because I'm happy with those areas in my life and the knowledge I have there, but because I'm not sure about my future career I tend to worry and think about that the most, and claim that I'm the happiest when that is more figure out. I dunno. I think I'll feel more accomplished when my career is figured out, but would I if my relationship wasn't good? Probably not. The people around me know I am strong in certain areas and they ask for advice in those areas, I that is common no matter what. You ask your mechanic for advice on how to fix your car, not on how to fix your teeth. That's what a dentist is for.
    </p>
    <p>
       I think my values will fit in well at DBC and I still don't feel comfortable comparing myself to any sort of stereotype threat. So many people have and will have it much worse than I have. There will be times at DBC where I feel dumb, or not worthy, or not in the correct line of work. I don't know how to overcome that other than to keep trying and do the best I can. I'm all in on DBC, and I'll be devastated if it doesn't work out.

  <h1>JavaScript</h1>
  <h4>5-1-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      First week of JavaScript in the books and I can't say I'm a very big fan. I hate the syntax compared to Ruby, I can't seem to figure out when to use semicolons and when not to, or when to put var instead of the variable or not. So far it just seems like it's safe to do those things, but maybe we don't need to.
    </p>
    <p>
       I'll admit, it's way too early to be judging JavaScript. I'm only one week in, less than that even. My frustrations this week are just around a new language in general, getting stuck for far too long on the simplest of fixes. Even with 4 weeks of Ruby knowledge I still struggle understanding when my program can reas certain variables. I found this to by a major issue in JS as well, as I tried to send and manipulate a variable between functions. I couldn't tell you how many times I got "undefined" spit back in my face. Very frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
       I did enjoy console.log more than puts/prints. I think it makes more sense to print something to the console by using console.log and seeing it in its form. I don't like that Ruby has p/puts/print. I still have a lot to learn about Ruby, so it's crazy to think of how much I have to learn about JavaScript. It will be interesting to see what else comes up over the next few weeks.

  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>4-22-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      Stereotype threat occurs when someone is feeling at risk of being judged based on a sterotype, and possibly proving the sterotype true, and because of this fear they perform worse than they would if this fear wasn't in their head. I don't feel very comfortable going into much detail on my assumptions on how a sterotype feels and what may come from stereotype threat. I think we can make the DBC workplace stereotype free, at least I know I will try to do my part in opening up to everyone and treating everyone with equal respect. Any assumpions I have on indiviuals prior to attending DBC will be based on small samples from Phase 0, and even those I will try to forget about as we head to Chicago. My apologies for the short post, but I just don't feel comfortable going any deeper into this topic. I will, however, read the thoughts of others to help me see things from their perspective. I feel that's important on topics like this.

  <h1>OOP Concepts</h1>
  <h2>Classes v. Modules</h2>
  <h4>4-22-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I wasn't (and still am not) very familiar with modules, which is the reason I wanted to Blog about them today. I've been pretty curious about classes v. modules myself, so I when I saw that on the challenge I knew they must be pretty similar. And it seems they are. Classes and modules are both used to group a bunch of code together, code that you will often want to type when building a giant program. They are tools to help you group specific lines of code together and easily use them over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      My understanding is modules can be used as a separate storage compartment when you need it. Classes are used to create instances but modules are not. Modules can collect methods and constants (and even classes!) but modules aren't used for instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modules can be used to store pieces of code that can then be used across multiple classes, let's say. If you look up modules (like I had to), you will often read that this helps prevent name clashes. If two methods or even two classes got named the same thing, modules can store them differently so your program knows which one to call on at the right time. Just think of modules as another layer of which to group and store your code.

  <h1>C5-Feedback</h1>
  <h2>Giving Feedback To Pairing Sessions</h2>
  <h4>4-17-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      Pairing at times can be interesting, although I do like them more than I thought I would. It can really be a benefit to bounce ideas off another student and ideally finish the challenge quicker since there's two of us on it. At times I like to work at my own pace, and I hate if my pair knows a LOT more than me and I feel like I slow them down. My ideal scenario is working with someone friendly, who has about the same knowledge as I do on these challenges beacuse I hate the thought of typing out ideas too slowly for my pair and/or guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to feedback most of the time I feel pretty good about it. I have struggled at other times in my life responding to negative feedback, even when the person giving the feedback means no harm. The one thing I really feel I need to do during pair sessions is be ready to quickly research an issue. I am still struggling with the Ruby docs and a couple times my pair has asked me to find our issue in the docs, so I need to get more familiar with the information that is there for us in the docs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing feedback is ok, I don't feel like it is very anonymous at DBC. It seems to be ordered in the exact order I paired, and I didn't have to do many pairing sessions before I was able to read the feedback given to me. Because of this, I have a hard time being mean or giving actionable feedback. For 1, I am a beginner, I mean who am I to tell someone how they should work through these challenges. And 2, I don't want to come across as ungreatful after someone helped me complete the challenge, b/c almost every time I've paried so far I've felt it helped me complete the challenge and that I was better off pairing than doing it on my own. So yes, I enjoy the pairing, but I just don't want to be giving my review of someone when I feel they can easily figure out it was me giving that review.

  <h1>DBC Week 5</h1>
  <h2>All About Ruby Classes</h2>
  <h4>4-17-15 (Otherwise known as Kris Bryant Day)</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I have spent a lot of time this week (and some last week) battling through Ruby Classes. Although I still don't have a full grasp of when and how to work with classes in Ruby, I have already seen how great they can be at keeping methods together. Classes keep being described as a blueprint everywhere I read, I like thinking of them like a folder on your computer. The folder (which you can name whatever you'd like) doesn't really do much on it's own, but once contents are stored inside, it provides a great, organized way of storing information. This is similar to classes in Ruby, it's a place to store your methods that make a function work. How is the program working like it does? You gotta look in the class to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since it is a special day for the Cubs, let's look at baseball and pretend that the league is played inside Ruby. The Chicago Cubs would be the name of a class, and inside that class you would find many different methods, like "Front Office", "Major League Players", "Minor League Players", "Grounds Crew", etc. Lots of different people make up the Chicago Cubs organization, just like lots of different methods can make up a class. These methods all do different things, but they are designed to work together to perform one finished product.
    </p>
    <p>
         But like I said, today is a special day. Today is the day the Cubs are calling up Kris Bryant from the minor leagues to make his major leauge debut. In Ruby, Bryant would be an instance variable. Bryant had been performing in the method minor league players, but there was an IF statement involved. IF @Bryant becomes too good for the minor leagues, the Major League Players method uses @Bryant. An instance variable can be used in multiple methods throughout the class. Maybe a better example for you die hards out there is that the method "Front Office" does nothing until date == April 17, then method "Major League Players" uses the instance variable @Bryant to help make their overall program perform better. In Ruby you call on different methods to do different things, but an instance variable can be used in multiple methods, just as long as they fall under the umbrella that is your Class. Now the Cubs, and baseball, are better today than they were yesterday.

  <h2>Updating Cybersecurity To Stop Hackers</h2>
  <h4>4-9-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      One thing that I always fear is having any of my information I enter online stolen by the millions of people searching(LURKING!!) around the internet. Although not a new problem, I think hackers continue to be a major concern as technology continues to grow and general consumers rely more and more on the internet to get through their daily lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not much into politics to be honest, but it will be interesting to see if cybersecurity can be controlled from a government level. I've always kind of thought about it as a double-edged sword. On one hand, I think everyone can agree the government needs to be aware of important cybersecurity breaches in hopes of finding way to make the internet more secure. But on the other hand, the public often complains about the government having access to too much information, especially when it comes to individual's personal information or conversations they may have over the internet. People want privacy from everyone, so should the government have the very access to information we want to keep away from hackers???
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it's important to get a bill passed in congress to allow all kinds of information sharing to the government in hopes of staying one step ahead of hackers and building better, more secure systems. This may be an ongoing battle as technologies continue to grow, but I hope we see more and more action taken place in Washington to hopefully deter hackers and keep the public's personal information in safe hands.

  <h1>Taking A Look At Map</h1>
  <h2>An Enumerable Object In Ruby</h2>
  <h4>4-9-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      Map is an interesting enumerable method and one that seems like it could/should be used quite often. The simple basics of map it to take an array and run every item in that array through a block of code, similar to what .each does. Map is different however because map keeps the items in an array, and map! replaces the original array with the newly mapped array.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used map in an earlier challenge this week during the insert commas into numbers challenge. I had different groups of individual numbers,four different numbers 1 2 3 4, and I needed it read as 1234. In order to push the numbers together I used .map{|y| y.join("")}. This took every number as y and ran the method join on them, and since I joined at ("") I took out the spaces between the numbers. It was the first time I had ever used map, and I think that's about the simplest way to use map.
    </p>
    <p>
        Obviously map can be used for a lot of other things, but it's important to keep in mind that map will keep your array items in array form. I say this because a lot of times map will just modifiy the items in the array that you are planning on calling upon later, chances are if you modify those items you'll want to use the modified versions instead of their original items. This is where map! comes in b/c you actually overwrite the original array with the mapped array. An example I found online while researching map! used an array full of names, but all the names were in lower case. To capitalize all the names in the array you could use names.map! {|x| x.capitalize}. Now the items in the array names have been changed from lower case to upper case. The array with lower case names is now gone forever and replaced with an array with upper case names (NOTE: inside the {} you can use any variable you want. I've used y and now x in my examples in this blog, but it doesn't matter what you call them). I have a feeling map! is likely to be more common than map as we continue down our programming path.

  <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
  <h2>And Relating It To DBC</h2>
  <h4>April Fools Day, 2015</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I have a concrete sequential thinking style and I haven't been able to figure out if that's good for me or bad for me. I definitely tend to go step by step in my thought process, but I am terrible at imagining what the end result will look like before I get there. I definitely wish I was better at thinking outside the box. However, I think the step by step approach has helped me so far in Phase0 b/c of how the challenges are presented to us at the beginning of each week.
    </p>
    <p>
        I feel that one of the biggest struggles for me is thinking of the answer quickly, especially one that takes multiple steps or has multiple ways of getting to the answer. At times it's nice that DBC is on my own time and my own schedule, but then when it comes to pairing I sometimes feel like I don't have enough time to stop and think about the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've mentioned it before but one of the reason I decided to do DBC was to change my mindset from fixed to growth. I understand I won't be able to fully change the way I think, but I want to rid myself of becoming depressed when I don't succeed. I tend to get frustrated and give up, and I don't want to be that way anymore. It happened once to me during week 1 and once during week 2 where I felt this information I was trying to learn was way over my head, and that all the other students were picking it up quicker than me, I have to keep reminding myself to push those thoughts out of my head and keep trying. Eventually I can get it, and the frustrating times will quickly pass.

        It's very hard for me to formulate a plan right now (who knows, maybe it's because of my mindset). I just don't know exactly what I need to do to prepare myself for Phase 1. I've worked in the city before and I have worked a long schedule of 12 hour days, 6-7 days a week, so I am not intimdated right now by the workload that phase 1 will bring. I usually get along with people well, and I truely am looking forward to meeting everyone and working with them in person, but I don't know right now about fixing my mindset. The only thing I can say is I want to be aware of my thoughts at all time and I want to catch myself before I go down the path to frustration.

  <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
  <h2>Understanding the Difference in Ruby</h2>
  <h4>April Fools Day, 2015</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I made a small tweak to the blog template so hopefully this works. More tweaks to come tomorrow. Arrays and hashes can both be useful tools in Ruby because instead of storing and assigning one variable at a time, A+H's let you store multiple variables at once. The difference is in how these values are stored.
    </p>
    <p>
        An array stores variables in an ordered fashion and saves each variable as a number (starting with 0) based on the order you store them in the array. Because of this an array is great for storing an ordered list of items.
    </p>
    <p>
        A hash on the other hand pairs the variables with a key and a value. Basically, each variable (value) can be named (key) so you can easily call upon that variable without having to know which place in the order it lands. I'm still in the very early stages of using both arrays and hashes, but they seem to be so similar that once you get the hang of using one, the other should be extremely easy to pickup.

  <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
  <h2>The Difference Between Absolute, Relative, and Fixed Positioning</h2>
  <h4>3-27-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      Positioning elements is one of the most important features to CSS, but can also be extremely confusing. In fact, I wrote this blog post b/c I was confused about positioning myself. Here I will go through the differences between Absolute, Relative, and Fixed positioning. There's a fourth type called Static, but that is the default position for any element, and is rarely ever used in CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first type of positioning is Absolute. Absolute positioning allows you to place an object wherever you want on the screen. The coordinates you type in are based on the screen. So if you type in
    <p>
       Selector {
      </p>
      <p> 
            position: absolute;
      </p>
      <p>      
            top: 0px;
      </p>
      <p>      
            left: 0px;
      </p>
      <p>      
    }
    </p>
    the element will be place in the top left corner of your screen. Absolute positioning can be great and easy, but it also takes elements out from the flow of the page, meaning it's difficult to use with other objects. This is where Relative Positioning comes in
    </p>
    <p>
        Relative Positioning places an object relative to itself and where it fits normally on the page. If you type in the same code as above but use relative instead of absolute, the object won't move at all because you told it to move from its top 0px and from its left 0px.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fixed Positioning essentially glues an object to the page so when you scroll the object an still be seen. It is great if you want a navagational bar to always be seen, but it can be dangerous because you don't want a fixed object to cover up other objects as you scroll down the page. Each type of position has its own pros and cons and figuring out which position is the best all depends on what type of design you want for your site.

  <h2>A Unique Culture, A Unique Experience</h2>
  <h4>3-19-15</h4>
  <section>
      <p>
      I just watched Shereef's Fireside Chat and really liked his Kitchen v. Table (Restaurant) example. I will say that my expectations of DBC didn't change, but maybe that's because of the research I've done on DBC prior to applying and starting Phase 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just because my expectations didn't change doesn't mean I'm not nervous. I am very nervous. I do sorta catch myself having a restaurant mindset, but even worse, I find that I definitely have a fixed mindset and have viewed things with a fixed mindset my whole life. I tend to expect myself to fail and it keeps me from experimenting. One of the main factors in choosing to do DBC is the hope that I can be guided into a different lifestyle and thought process. I think it's great that DBC has a setup where you can not only learn code and become a great developer, but also you can become a better person.
    </p>
    <p>
        The learning experience will probably take some getting used to for me, and I know I won't be able to change my mindset overnight. I know I will be passive, I know I am a novice, and I know at times I can struggle keeping up, but I think I'm already in the process of changing my lifestyle, and that's something I'm very excited about. I know there will be many people in the same boat as me, and I can't wait to meet them and go down this crazy river with them.

  <h2>Learning Git</h2>
  <h4>3-18-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      Git is a type of version control that helps its users keep track of work flow. Git helps you save your changes as you go, so you will always have safe spots to fall back on should you make a mistake with your code in the future. Git also works well when multiple people are working on the same project. Git helps those people work on different tasks at the same time without worry of working on an outdated file. Git allows branches of the tree to be modified, without any worry of the trunk being destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
       Anytime a change is made to a file, it will show up in your git status. Typing git status into your terminal will bring up a few sections. If your file is new, you will see it in the Untracked Files section. If you made a change to an existing file, you will see it in the Changes Not Staged For Commit section. Git provides instructions for each section on how to go about sending these files to the Changes To Be Committed section. Think of committing as a final confirmation before pushing these files to the web. You can only push files after they have been committed. Once pushed, they will appear remotely on the web, in this case GitHub.

       
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub allows users to send their work to the web easily by linking up with the Git on their computer. With GitHub, Bob in TN can work on a project with Lynn in VA and they both can get updates by pushing and pulling their work to/from GitHub. Git helps you keep track of your changes by easily accessing a log by typing git log in your terminal. Your git log shows every change that has been pushed to GitHub.
