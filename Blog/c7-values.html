  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h2>Exploring Values For DBC</h2>
  <h4>5-1-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      The two values that really stuck out were Accomplishment and Meaningful Work. I'm always trying to live up to these values, it always seems like I have someone in the back of my head telling me to do something more meaningful. That's kinda where I am today, I was unsatisfied with my past and I wanted to push myself as far as I can to see what I can acheive. But I still am always looking for someone else to tell me I'm valuable/needed/wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's kinda funny, the topics I get asked for advice on tend to deal with sports or relationships. Both things are very, very important in my life but they aren't the values I worry/think about the most. Maybe because I'm happy with those areas in my life and the knowledge I have there, but because I'm not sure about my future career I tend to worry and think about that the most, and claim that I'm the happiest when that is more figure out. I dunno. I think I'll feel more accomplished when my career is figured out, but would I if my relationship wasn't good? Probably not. The people around me know I am strong in certain areas and they ask for advice in those areas, I that is common no matter what. You ask your mechanic for advice on how to fix your car, not on how to fix your teeth. That's what a dentist is for.

       I think my values will fit in well at DBC and I still don't feel comfortable comparing myself to any sort of stereotype threat. So many people have and will have it much worse than I have. There will be times at DBC where I feel dumb, or not worthy, or not in the correct line of work. I don't know how to overcome that other than to keep trying and do the best I can. I'm all in on DBC, and I'll be devastated if it doesn't work out.
