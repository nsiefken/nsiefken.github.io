        Working on this website has been one of the more rewarding things about Phase 0. Even though CSS has been pretty frustrating at times and my interest isn't really in web design, I feel very proud of the site I have created from scratch. I remember back in the beginning of Phase 0 when I created the site and some of my material was actually on the web for the first time, I thought that was cool just to see it go from computer to web. But it was ugly, I messed with CSS for a long while getting things organized and I looked up many different color schemes. Still ugly.

        I remember sometime in April working many, many hours just on CSS. I basically created my own color scheme and design and I don't want to go away from what you see anytime soon. Obviously this site is basic, but that's what it's meant to be. I just want it for my blog posts right now. It still takes me a lot of time linking each post to all the other posts I've written so far. That's something I like about my site, it makes naviagation extremely easy, I just don't know if it's scalable in the long run. But for phase 0, at least, I wanted to make sure every blog post linked to every other one.

         This week I went back through the different HTML pages I created and modified the order of things, so it was easier for me to read and navigate. As you can see my index page is getting quite long. Again, I like it that way for Phase 0, but may need to change my design during Phase 1. I'm also contemplating adding different buttons for links, something I might come back to later this week after I practice more JS and Ruby.
