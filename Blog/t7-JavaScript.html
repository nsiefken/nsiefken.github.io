  <h1>JavaScript</h1>

      First week of JavaScript in the books and I can't say I'm a very big fan. I hate the syntax compared to Ruby, I can't seem to figure out when to use semicolons and when not to, or when to put var instead of the variable or not. So far it just seems like it's safe to do those things, but maybe we don't need to.

       I'll admit, it's way too early to be judging JavaScript. I'm only one week in, less than that even. My frustrations this week are just around a new language in general, getting stuck for far too long on the simplest of fixes. Even with 4 weeks of Ruby knowledge I still struggle understanding when my program can reas certain variables. I found this to by a major issue in JS as well, as I tried to send and manipulate a variable between functions. I couldn't tell you how many times I got "undefined" spit back in my face. Very frustrating.

       I did enjoy console.log more than puts/prints. I think it makes more sense to print something to the console by using console.log and seeing it in its form. I don't like that Ruby has p/puts/print. I still have a lot to learn about Ruby, so it's crazy to think of how much I have to learn about JavaScript. It will be interesting to see what else comes up over the next few weeks.
