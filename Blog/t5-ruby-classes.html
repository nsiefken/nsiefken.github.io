  <h1>DBC Week 5</h1>
  <h2>All About Ruby Classes</h2>
  <h4>4-17-15 (Otherwise known as Kris Bryant Day)</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I have spent a lot of time this week (and some last week) battling through Ruby Classes. Although I still don't have a full grasp of when and how to work with classes in Ruby, I have already seen how great they can be at keeping methods together. Classes keep being described as a blueprint everywhere I read, I like thinking of them like a folder on your computer. The folder (which you can name whatever you'd like) doesn't really do much on it's own, but once contents are stored inside, it provides a great, organized way of storing information. This is similar to classes in Ruby, it's a place to store your methods that make a function work. How is the program working like it does? You gotta look in the class to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since it is a special day for the Cubs, let's look at baseball and pretend that the league is played inside Ruby. The Chicago Cubs would be the name of a class, and inside that class you would find many different methods, like "Front Office", "Major League Players", "Minor League Players", "Grounds Crew", etc. Lots of different people make up the Chicago Cubs organization, just like lots of different methods can make up a class. These methods all do different things, but they are designed to work together to perform one finished product.
    </p>
    <p>
        But like I said, today is a special day. Today is the day the Cubs are calling up Kris Bryant from the minor leagues to make his major leauge debut. In Ruby, Bryant would be an instance variable. Bryant had been performing in the method minor league players, but there was an IF statement involved. IF @Bryant becomes too good for the minor leagues, the Major League Players method uses @Bryant. An instance variable can be used in multiple methods throughout the class. Maybe a better example for you die hards out there is that the method "Front Office" does nothing until date == April 17, then method "Major League Players" uses the instance variable @Bryant to help make their overall program perform better. In Ruby you call on different methods to do different things, but an instance variable can be used in multiple methods, just as long as they fall under the umbrella that is your Class. Now the Cubs, and baseball, are better today than they were yesterday.
