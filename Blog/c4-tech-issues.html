  <h1>Tech Issues</h1>
  <h2>Updating Cybersecurity To Stop Hackers</h2>
  <h4>4-9-15</h4>
  <section>

      One thing that I always fear is having any of my information I enter online stolen by the millions of people searching(LURKING!!) around the internet. Although not a new problem, I think hackers continue to be a major concern as technology continues to grow and general consumers rely more and more on the internet to get through their daily lives.

      I am not much into politics to be honest, but it will be interesting to see if cybersecurity can be controlled from a government level. I've always kind of thought about it as a double-edged sword. On one hand, I think everyone can agree the government needs to be aware of important cybersecurity breaches in hopes of finding way to make the internet more secure. But on the other hand, the public often complains about the government having access to too much information, especially when it comes to individual's personal information or conversations they may have over the internet. People want privacy from everyone, so should the government have the very access to information we want to keep away from hackers???

      I think it's important to get a bill passed in congress to allow all kinds of information sharing to the government in hopes of staying one step ahead of hackers and building better, more secure systems. This may be an ongoing battle as technologies continue to grow, but I hope we see more and more action taken place in Washington to hopefully deter hackers and keep the public's personal information in safe hands.
