    <h1>Asking All These Questions</h1>
    
    <h4>5-12-15</h4>
    <section>
      <p>
        I at times have a hard time asking questions in DBC because I'm so new to everything I am learning, I don't even know exactly what to ask. Sometimes it's important to stop and focus on what the exact issue is before asking the question. I know I struggle with not being clear in what I'm asking for.
      </p>
      <p>
         At first I felt like I was exposing my ignorance by asking questions that hadn't been asked yet. I felt like since nobody has asked the question, it must be easy to figure out on my own. Other times I would ask a question that didn't get may(any) responses, this led me to think the question was very difficult to figure out. Either way, both of these thought processes are wrong. I need to do a better job at not being scared to ask a question, AND to word it in a way that makes people want to answer it. Nobody is going to want to answer a question that is confusing/time consuming. I want to do a better job at being direct, so the person I'm asking the question to will know exactly what kind of answer I am looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
         I also want to be better about not interrupting. Most of the questions I've asked "in person" have been via Google Hangouts. Sometimes the person is giving me an answer and I'm quick to jump in to share that I either understand or am still confused. It's tough to read body language over the Hangout, and sometimes there's a pause where I think the person answering is finished, these things make it more difficult to just communicate in general. I think I'll do better in person once Phase 1 starts, but I will make sure to really stop and listen to everything the person has to say for an answer before I jump in with a follow up response.
