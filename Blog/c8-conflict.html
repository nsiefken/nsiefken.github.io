  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  
  <h4>5-5-15</h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      I still don't feel very comfortable talking about personal and private situations on a blog, having no clue who will read it and when it may possibly be read. And I don't even mind talking about personal situations, I would just prefer to do it in a personal setting, not a public one (without any direct feedback). For the sake of doing this assignment I will talk about a small conflict I had in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conflict I can look back and laugh at happened when I was rooming with one of my best friends. I've been friends with him for 10 years now and I can't believe looking back that we had a period of about a month where we lived together but didn't talk to each other. Things built up over time but boiled over one night when I was in the basement watching TV pretty late at night and my friend, Ross, told me that another guy was going to stay the night. No big deal, we were like a hotel, guys and girls stayed over all the time. But in this case, the person was going to sleep in the basement (where I was watching TV), and was going to go to bed now and I need to go upstairs. This bothered me for multiple reasons: 1. things were starting to build up between us anyway, so I didn't have a desire to do something nice for him, but 2. I didn't appreciate being told what I had to do, and I also didn't like that it was in favor of some other guy that I didn't know and who didn't live with us. I was angry b/c I felt like I wasn't being treated like a good friend. We were both stubborn and we both tried to stand our ground, for faaaaaaar too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back on it I can't even remember the things that built up before that incident, I think a lot of little things split up our friendship slowly and then that just threw a huge wedge in there. Some questions arose like "maybe we aren't that great of friends, and maybe we shouldn't be living together". We gave each other a lot of space for a few weeks after that and then finally apologized for acting like idiots. Now we are great friends still today, I thought about writing this b/c it really does shock me that we ever argued at all. I don't think we have since. I definitely would go back in time and talk through the situation even before the incident happened. There was no need to try and stand our ground and act the the alpha male. I've definitely learned over the years that it's almost always better to talk through any issues or thoughts I'm having, before the build up and become more difficult to control. It's kind of a stupid example for this assignment, but it was a disagreement that I look back on and just laugh.
